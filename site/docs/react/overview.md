# Using Keywork With React

Keywork has everything you need to serve React apps from your Worker.

- Static prop handlers that feel just like your typical API endpoints.
- Server-side rendering from your worker, made even faster with streamed responses.
- Routing helpers with a low-mental overhead that make splitting your app into separate workers a breeze.
- Client-side hydration that fits into your existing build pipeline.

# Install

If you haven't already done so, install the `keywork` module.

```shell title=Run in the root of your Worker project.
$ yarn add keywork
```

:::info
Keywork's docs are being updated frequently.
However, the API reference is available for the bravehearted.
