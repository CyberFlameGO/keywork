**Keywork** is a batteries-included, _magic-free_, library for building web apps on Cloudflare Workers.

Keywork may be right for you if...

- You're building your web app almost entirely within the Cloudflare Workers platform
- You find yourself building a lot of "glue-code" to wrangle your growing set of Workers
- Your site is hosted on a single Worker and you'd like to split its logic into smaller and more managable bundles
- Your application routing logic is too complex for Cloudflare Pages
- You'd like to use Workers KV as a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Firebase
