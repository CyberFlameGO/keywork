## Install

Keywork apps are framework agnostic and can compliment your existing codebase:

```shell title=Run in the root of your Cloudflare Worker project.
$ yarn add keywork
```

If you're building a React app, Keywork fits right in:

```shell title=Run in the root of your Cloudflare Worker project.
$ yarn add @keywork/react-isomorphic
```

:::info
Keywork's docs are being updated frequently.
However, the API reference is available for the bravehearted.
